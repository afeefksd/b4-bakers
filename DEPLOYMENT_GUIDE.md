Via Vercel Dashboard:

3. Redeploy for changes to take effect

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "KV is not defined" or similar errors

**Solution**: Make sure you've created and connected the Vercel KV database to your project, then redeploy.

### Issue: Image uploads failing

**Solution**: Ensure Vercel Blob is set up and the BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN is available in your environment variables.

### Issue: Can't login to admin

**Solution**: Check that ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable is set correctly. Note: Environment variable changes require a redeployment.

### Issue: Banners/Brands not showing

**Solution**: Make sure the image files are in the public folder and committed to your repository.

### Issue: WhatsApp link not working

**Solution**: Verify WHATSAPP_NUMBER is in the correct format (country code + number without + or spaces, e.g., 919876543210)
