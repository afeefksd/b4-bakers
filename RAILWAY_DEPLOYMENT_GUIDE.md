# Railway Deployment Guide

Complete guide for deploying B4-Baking website on Railway with PostgreSQL database.

## Why Railway?

Railway was chosen for this deployment because it offers:

âœ… **Cost-Effective**: Free tier with $5 monthly credit
âœ… **Built-in PostgreSQL**: No external database service needed
âœ… **Persistent Storage**: File uploads persist across deployments
âœ… **Automatic Deployments**: Push to GitHub and it deploys automatically
âœ… **Easy Setup**: No complex configuration required

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- GitHub account
- Your code pushed to a GitHub repository
- Railway account (sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app))

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Make sure your code is pushed to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Create Railway Project

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. If first time, authorize Railway to access your GitHub
5. Select your `b4baking-web` repository
6. Railway will automatically detect it's a Next.js project

### 3. Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project dashboard, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Database"**
3. Choose **"Add PostgreSQL"**
4. Railway will provision a database and automatically set `DATABASE_URL`

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

1. Click on your **web service** (the one with your code)
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"+ New Variable"**
4. Add these variables:

| Variable Name | Example Value | Description |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `MySecurePass123!` | Password for admin panel |
| `WHATSAPP_NUMBER` | `919876543210` | WhatsApp number (country code + number, no +) |

**Note**: `DATABASE_URL` is automatically provided by the PostgreSQL service, don't add it manually.

### 5. Wait for Deployment

1. Railway will automatically build and deploy your application
2. Watch the **"Deployments"** tab for progress
3. Build typically takes 2-5 minutes
4. Once complete, you'll see a green checkmark

### 6. Get Your Public URL

1. In your web service, go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Domains"** section
3. Click **"Generate Domain"**
4. You'll get a URL like: `b4baking-web-production.up.railway.app`
5. Copy this URL

### 7. Initialize the Database

This is a **critical step** - you must do this once after first deployment:

1. Visit: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/init`
2. You should see:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Database initialized successfully",
     "success": true
   }
   ```
3. This creates all database tables and seeds initial data

### 8. Verify Your Deployment

Test these URLs:

- **Homepage**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`
- **Shop**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/shop`
- **Admin Login**: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/admin/login`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot connect to database"

**Solution**: Make sure PostgreSQL service is running and linked:
1. Check PostgreSQL service status (should be green)
2. Verify `DATABASE_URL` variable exists in your web service
3. Try redeploying the web service

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized" when uploading images

**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in to the admin panel:
1. Go to `/admin/login`
2. Enter your `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
3. Try uploading again

### Issue: Uploaded images don't persist

**Solution**: Railway requires persistent volumes for file storage:
1. In your web service, go to "Settings"
2. Scroll to "Volumes"
3. Add a volume mounted at `/app/public/uploads`
4. Redeploy the service

### Issue: Database initialization fails

**Solution**: Check PostgreSQL logs:
1. Click on PostgreSQL service
2. Check "Logs" tab for errors
3. Ensure database is fully provisioned (takes 1-2 minutes)
4. Try visiting `/api/init` again

### Issue: Build fails

**Solution**: Check the build logs:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click on failed deployment
3. Check error messages
4. Common fixes:
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Check for TypeScript errors
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility

## Managing Your Application

### Viewing Logs

1. Click on your web service
2. Go to **"Logs"** tab
3. See real-time application logs
4. Use for debugging issues

### Redeploying

**Automatic**: Push to GitHub main branch
```bash
git push origin main
```

**Manual**: In Railway dashboard
1. Go to "Deployments"
2. Click "Deploy" on latest commit

### Environment Variable Changes

After changing environment variables:
1. Railway automatically redeploys
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Changes take effect immediately

### Database Backups

Railway Pro plans include automatic backups:
1. Click on PostgreSQL service
2. Go to "Backups" tab
3. Configure backup schedule

Free tier: Use manual backups via pg_dump

### Monitoring Usage

Check your usage to stay within free tier:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "Usage" in sidebar
3. Monitor:
   - Execution hours
   - Network bandwidth
   - Database storage

## Cost Optimization

### Free Tier Limits

Railway provides $5 credit monthly:
- Typically covers small to medium traffic sites
- ~500 hours of runtime
- PostgreSQL included

### Staying Within Free Tier

1. **Optimize Images**: Compress before uploading
2. **Monitor Traffic**: Check usage regularly
3. **Efficient Queries**: Database queries are optimized
4. **Static Assets**: Images served from same server (no CDN costs)

### When You Outgrow Free Tier

If you exceed $5/month:
1. Railway charges overage at pay-as-you-go rates
2. Typically $5-10/month for small business sites
3. Still very cost-effective compared to competitors

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Strong Admin Password

```env
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Use@Strong#Password123!
```

- Minimum 12 characters
- Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
- Don't share publicly

### 2. Environment Variables

- Never commit `.env` files to Git
- Always use Railway's Variables tab
- Rotate passwords periodically

### 3. Database Security

- Railway PostgreSQL is private by default
- Only accessible within your project
- SSL enabled automatically

### 4. Regular Updates

Keep dependencies updated:
```bash
npm update
npm audit fix
```

## Scaling Your Application

### Horizontal Scaling

Railway supports multiple instances:
1. Go to web service "Settings"
2. Increase "Replicas" count
3. Load balancing automatic

### Database Scaling

1. Upgrade PostgreSQL plan in Railway
2. More storage, RAM, CPU available
3. Pricing scales with usage

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. âœ… Test all functionality
2. âœ… Add products via admin panel
3. âœ… Upload custom banners
4. âœ… Add brand logos
5. âœ… Test quote request flow
6. âœ… Share your site URL with customers
